## Overview

### The challenge

- Build out the project to the designs provided

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

- BEM CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

**Dual Background** 

I never used it, so i had to research it a bit. Main question marks, "should i set dual background image and how do i position them"? It's Possible and not that hard.

```css
#example1 {
  background-image: url(img_flwr.gif), url(paper.gif);
  background-position: right bottom, left top;
  background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
}
```

**Background Position**
Setting the background-position was more tricky, but with some trial and error i ended up with this code.

```css
background-position: left -40rem top -30rem, right -40rem bottom -30rem;
```
